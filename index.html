                    ongoing process and forever evolving. For me, it's been so empowering and has given me so much
                    value.</p>

                <p class="part-des">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                    skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Education originated as
                    transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                    increasingly encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented
                    information, skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

                <p class="part-title">History of Education</p>
                <p class="part-des">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and
                    skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and
                    through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the
                    next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                    through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                    Kingdom.</p>

                <p class="part-des">Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education
                    for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of technological
                    advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in developing
                    countries. Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures
                    through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.</p>
